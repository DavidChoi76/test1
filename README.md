### Welcome to My GitHub. ðŸ‘‹

I'm YoungDon Choi, an principal researcher at AI research laboratory in K-water. I have worked at K-water (https://www.kwater.or.kr/eng/about/sub02/kwaterPage.do?s_mid=1099) since 2003 with many experinces such as dam operation, water resources survey and planning, water technology strategy, and water information system.
Currently, I'm working at AI research lab to apply AI in water resources fields. 

I did my PhD from 2017 to 2021 at UVA Hydroinformatics research group (https://uvahydroinformatics.org/team/) in University of Virginia (https://www.virginia.edu/). This is my Dissertation (https://doi.org/10.18130/g9tg-0c69), google scholar(https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=VCyCE5QAAAAJ&hl=en) and Resume(https://github.com/DavidChoi76/profile/blob/main/YD_Choi_17June2022.pdf)
